# Fuzzy, evolutionary and Neuro-computing exercises

Project  assignments for class Fuzzy, evolutionary and Neuro-computing

## Fuzzy computing

First part of the class is Fuzzy computing. The assignment was to 
implement data structures which will be FuzzySets and other data needed
for working with them.

The final assignment was to implement fuzzy control over boat in already made
simulator (simulator is NOT INCLUDED here).
